# This file defines automated storage transfers from pusher-* to archive-*
# and, for production, from archive-mlab-oti to archive-measurement-lab
# The overall schedule is (all times UTC):
#     pusher ->         archive: 02:30, 14:30
#     oti    -> measurement-lab: 06:30, 18:30
#
# NOTE: four hour delays are based on typical transfer times for recent GCS ST
# jobs (2020-07-15).
